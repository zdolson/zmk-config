 *  Xiao BLE Pin Verification
 *  
 *  Seems like some pins might be electrically connected, so testing various pins for signal.
 *  If the forum link is for the Xiao BLE (not original Xiao), the pins 5/8 and 4/10 are connected. :'(
 *  @see https://forum.seeedstudio.com/t/xiao-are-pin-4-and-pin-10-electrically-connected-100-reproduced-on-3-boards/263128/12
 * 
 *  GPIO Pins :: Notes
 *          0 :: Doesn't seem to work (kscan + encoder)
 *          1 :: Works, tested with kscan
 *          2 :: Doesn't seem to work (kscan)
 *          3 :: Doesn't seem to work (kscan)
 *          4 :: Works, tested with kscan + encoder
 *          5 :: Works, tested with kscan + encoder
 *          6 :: Works, tested with kscan
 *          7 :: Works, tested with kscan
 *          8 :: Works, tested with kscan
 *          9 :: Previously didn't work (Test again)
 *         10 :: Previously didn't work (Test again)
